  privacy_compliance: Privacy Compliance
  what_is_a_privacy: What is a privacy policy, and do I need a lawyer to write one?
  a_privacy_policy: A privacy policy (also referred to as a privacy notice) is a statement or legal document that describes how a company, website, or app collects, uses, maintains, and shares data collected from or about its users. Most countries require any website that collects personal information from its users to have a written privacy policy posted on the website. You do not need a lawyer to write a privacy policy. However, it’s recommended that you consult with a lawyer when creating your privacy policy to ensure it meets all legal requirements that apply to your specific business and jurisdiction.
  what_is_the_difference: What is the difference between a privacy policy and terms and conditions?
  the_difference_between: The difference between a privacy policy and terms and conditions is that a privacy policy protects your users’ rights, while terms and conditions protect your website’s rights. Privacy policies outline how you interact with user data, and terms and conditions outline the rules for using your site, along with the rights you retain under relevant laws and regulations.
  what_is_consent: What is consent in the context of GDPR?
  consent_here_refers: Consent here refers to the informed voluntary agreement of an individual to engage in a particular event or process. Broadly speaking, users need to be able to decline, withdraw or give consent. Consent may be acquired using any method that would require the user to take a direct and verifiable affirmative action; these can include checkboxes, text fields, toggle buttons, sending an email in confirmation, and so on. In the context of GDPR, cookie consent is the act of consenting to, rejecting, or specifying the use of cookies on a website. Unlike other laws regarding cookie consent, the GDPR requires that websites give users options for which cookies are used, if any, as they access a site. To comply with the GDPR’s cookie consent requirements, your website or app needs a cookie consent function that users see before cookies can be applied. The consent function can appear as a banner, popup, or form that users will see and can interact with when they enter your site.
  what_is_gdpr: What is GDPR?
  gdpr_is_a_regulation: GDPR is a regulation to strengthen data protection for all individuals within the European Union (EU). This means that if you have a website that processes data related to people in the EU, you need to follow laws and procedures to become compliant. Besides the GDPR, many regions around the globe are putting in place privacy laws which businesses are expected to comply with.
  whats_the_risk: What’s the risk if I don’t comply?
  the_gdpr_has: The GDPR has multiple penalties against those who violate its privacy and security standards, with fines reaching into millions of euros. Some possible penalties include financial penalties (up to EUR 20 million or up to 4% of annual worldwide turnover), disciplinary measures, as well as compensation for damages or damaged reputation.
  does_the_gdpr_apply: Does the GDPR apply to U.S.-based businesses and websites?
  yes_the_gdpr_does: Yes, the GDPR does apply to US websites that collect the personal data of EU residents. Personal data includes any identifying information, such as names, contact information, and device details. Non-compliance with the GDPR could lead to fines and legal penalties, even for U.S.-based businesses and websites.
  what_is_ccpa: What is CCPA?
  the_california_consumer: The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) is a privacy regulation aimed to guarantee protection for all individuals in California. It applies to any businesses that collect, use, or share user's personal data, whether the information was obtained online or offline.
  what_constitutes: What constitutes personal data?
  the_law_defines: The law defines personal data as any information that relates to an identifiable living individual. Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead to the identification of a particular person, also constitute personal data — for example, first or last name, a cookie ID, or email.
  plans_and_payment: Plans and Payment Options
  what_payment_methods: What payment methods do you support?
  we_support_all_major: We support all major credit cards such as Visa, Matercard, American Express, and Discover. Subscriptions are processed using Chargebee and payments are processed using Stripe, so you may see these names appear on your credit card statement.
  will_i_get: Will I get a VAT invoice?
  yes_if_you_enter: Yes, if you enter your VAT information during signing up you'll receive an invoice specifying the VAT amounts. All listed prices do not include VAT. VAT is calculated upon entering billing information.
  whats_your_cancellation: What's your cancellation policy?
  you_can_cancel: You can cancel at any time unless you have a long-term contract with us. If that is the case, please contact your account manager.
  do_you_have: Do you have a refund policy?
  we_do_not_offer: We do not offer refunds. If you cancel an active plan, you have full access to your account until the end date of your last paid subscription period.
  can_i_change: Can I change my plan?
  you_can_make: You can make changes to your plan at any time. If for instance, you start on the Free plan, you can upgrade to the Business or Enterprise plan at any later time.

  what_is_the_gdpr: What is the GDPR?
  the_eu_general_data: The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulatory framework for data protection and privacy, which covers virtually every aspect of business and information management — from the consent to collect and process information to the right to be deleted.
  the_gdpr_applies: The GDPR applies to any business that processes EU citizen data, regardless of whether it’s based in the EU. So even if you run an ecommerce company based in Asia, a blog based out of the U.S., or a SaaS based in Australia — and have customers, readers, or even just visitors based in the EU — you are required to achieve demonstrable compliance with the GDPR.
  what_are_the_risks: What are the risks if I don’t comply?
  much_like_other: Much like other major privacy regulations such as CCPA, the GDPR, too, has a number of different penalties that can be imposed on any company that violates EU privacy and security standards, with fines reaching into hundreds of millions.
  financial_penalties: Financial penalties
  art_83_of: Art. 83 of GDPR states that non-compliance with the EU requirements can carry fines up to EUR 20 million, or in the case of a corporation, up to 4% of annual worldwide turnover, whichever is higher.
  disciplinary_mesures: Disciplinary measures
  a_number_of_corrective: A number of corrective measures can be imposed, including warnings, reprimands, imposing temporary or permanent bans on the processing of data, demanding the rectification and/or deletion of data, and suspending the transfer of data for a period of time.
  compensation_for_damages: Compensation for damages
  any_data_subject: Any data subject (user) who has suffered damages has the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor who has not complied with the obligations. A third-party — such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Mailchimp, and others — can also take legal action against you, terminate service, or permanently ban your company.
  damaged_reputation: Damaged reputation
  how_you_handle: How you handle personal data can be a competitive (dis)advantage, and it can make or break your reputation. LegalSite helps you strengthen your brand’s trust proposition through granular level consent for users while driving value for your data protection and compliance journey.

  all_requests_are: All requests are accompanied by strict deadlines and communication requirements.

  data_processors_role: The data processors role
  data_subject_requests_encompass: Data subject requests encompass all the personal information you hold about the data subject, as well as all the information your data processors hold. Data processors do not provide personal data to the data subject directly. Instead, the data subject submits a request to you, the data controller, who is required to gather it from your processors.
  stop_wasting_resources: Stop wasting resources on data requests
