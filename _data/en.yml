nps:
  improve_customer: Improve customer loyalty<br> with Net Promoter Score<sup>®</sup>
  want_to_know: Want to know how loyal your customers are? Curious to learn if your buyers recommend you to others? Looking to make sure your clients are happy?
  sign_up: Start Getting Answers
  what_is_nps: What is <span>NPS<sup>®</sup></span> and how does it work?
  nps_commonly: Net Promoter Score®, commonly referred to as NPS®, is one of the most prevalent customer experience metrics used by companies around the world. Its prime function is to measure the likelihood of your customers recommending your business, products, or services to friends or colleagues.
  nps_methodology: The Net Promoter Score® methodology is based on asking customers a single question that predicts the likelihood of both repurchase and referral
  how_likely: <span>“How likely is it that you would recommend XYZ to a friend or <span>colleague?</span>”</span>
  customers_rate: Customers rate their answers on a scale from 0 to 10, and based on their answers, they are placed into three groups
  promoters_passives: promoters, passives, and detractors.
  detractors: <span>Detractors</span>, those who respond in the 0–6 range, are unhappy customers who can hurt your brand through negative word-of-mouth. <span>Passives</span>, or respondents who choose 7 or 8, are satisfied but indifferent customers who could be swayed by the competition. Finally, <span>Promoters</span>, or respondents who choose 9 or 10, are loyal superfans who will keep buying and referring others.
  get_answers: Get Answers
  how_nps_helps: How <span>NPS<sup>®</sup></span> helps companies like yours
  the_nps_survey: The NPS<sup>®</sup> survey gets you the data you need to quickly understand how customers feel about your brand and business overall, as well as to react to any negative feedback proactively.
  because_nps: Because NPS<sup>®</sup> is a leading indicator from growth, it provides the best anchor for your customer experience management (CEM) program. NPS® data can be used to predict and prevent customers from leaving, thus reducing churn rates. An NPS<sup>®</sup> score also makes it easy to set both internal performance benchmarks, as well as external benchmarks to compare against competitors in your industry.
  complement_nps: Complement NPS<sup>®</sup> with other metrics and insights from various points along the customer journey, and you’ll gain a comprehensive, actionable view of your customer experience performance.
  nps_net_promoter: NPS, Net Promoter & Net Promoter Score are registered trademarks of Satmetrix Systems, Inc., Bain & Company and Fred Reichheld.

five_stars:
  turn_feedback_from: Turn feedback from<br> 5-star surveys into results
  send_responsive: Send responsive 5-star surveys that look good across all devices and platforms. Ask follow-up questions to gain crucial insights and show your stakeholders that you’re listening.
  sign_up: Start Getting Answers
  what_is_a: What is a <span>5-star</span> survey and how does it work?
  using_stars_as: Using stars as a rating dates all the way back to 1844 when they were first used to rate restaurants. They were later popularized by Michelin Guides in 1931 as a three-star system. The 5-star rating system, as we know it today, allows respondents to rank their experience with a business, service, product, event (or anything at all, really) on a scale from 1 to 5. The more stars are selected, the more positive the experience. Conversely, the fewer stars are selected, the less positive the experience.
  when_star_ratings: When star ratings are accompanied by qualitative reviews, they tend to encourage more meaningful considerations and engagement. FeedbackLabs allows you to ask contextual follow-up questions after the initial 5-star survey to gain crucial insight on your customer's response and show your stakeholders that you’re listening. In fact, you can fully customize your survey, as well as tailor follow-up questions based on the initial 5-star survey response. 
  how_surveys_help: How <span>5-star surveys</span> help companies like yours
  the_star_rating: The 5-star rating system can not only help make people feel more confident about their purchasing decisions, but it can also guide those decisions. Whether it’s ordering from a restaurant, buying a new pair of pants from an ecommerce store, scheduling an appointment with a new dentist, or purchasing any other goods and services, consumers rely on this well-known system to weed out “bad” options and find the “best” ones. Without the stars, offerings on large online platforms would be a lot more overwhelming. 
  your_marketing: Your marketing team can also feature compelling customer comments from 5-star surveys on your website and social media, or use them in email marketing to boost conversions rates and improve your bottom line.
