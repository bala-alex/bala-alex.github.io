  what_is_nps: What is <span>NPS</span><sup>®</sup> and how does it work?
  nps_commonly: Net Promoter Score<sup>SM</sup>, commonly referred to as NPS, is one of the most prevalent customer experience metrics used by companies around the world. Its prime function is to measure the likelihood of your customers recommending your business, products, or services to friends or colleagues.
  nps_methodology: The Net Promoter Score methodology is based on asking customers a single question that predicts the likelihood of both repurchase and referral
  how_likely: <span>“How likely is it that you would recommend XYZ to a friend or <span>colleague?</span>”</span>
  customers_rate: Customers rate their answers on a scale from 0 to 10, and based on their answers, they are placed into three groups
  promoters_passives: promoters, passives, and detractors.
  detractors: <span>Detractors</span>, those who respond in the 0–6 range, are unhappy customers who can hurt your brand through negative word-of-mouth. <span>Passives</span>, or respondents who choose 7 or 8, are satisfied but indifferent customers who could be swayed by the competition. Finally, <span>Promoters</span>, or respondents who choose 9 or 10, are loyal superfans who will keep buying and referring others.
  get_answers: Get Answers
  how_nps_helps: How <span>NPS</span> helps companies like yours
  the_nps_survey: The NPS survey gets you the data you need to quickly understand how customers feel about your brand and business overall, as well as to react to any negative feedback proactively.
  because_nps: Because NPS is a leading indicator of growth, it provides the best anchor for your customer experience management (CEM) program. NPS data can be used to predict and prevent customers from leaving, thus reducing churn rates. And having an NPS score makes it easy to set both internal performance benchmarks, as well as external benchmarks to compare against competitors in your industry.
  complement_nps: Complement NPS with other metrics and insights from various points along the customer journey, and you’ll gain a comprehensive, actionable view of your customer experience performance.
  nps_net_promoter: Net Promoter<sup>®</sup> and NPS<sup>®</sup> are registered trademarks — and Net Promoter Score<sup>℠</sup> is a service mark — of Bain & Company, Inc., Satmetrix Systems, Inc., and Fred Reichheld.

  what_is_a: What is a <span>5-star</span> survey and how does it work?
  using_stars_as: Using stars as a rating dates all the way back to 1844 when they were first used to rate restaurants. They were later popularized by Michelin Guides in 1931 as a three-star system. The 5-star rating system, as we know it today, allows respondents to rank their experience with a business, service, product, event (or anything at all, really) on a scale from 1 to 5. The more stars are selected, the more positive the experience. Conversely, the fewer stars are selected, the less positive the experience.
  when_star_ratings: When star ratings are accompanied by qualitative reviews, they tend to encourage more meaningful considerations and engagement. FeedbackLabs allows you to ask contextual follow-up questions after the initial 5-star survey to gain crucial insight on your customer's response and show your stakeholders that you’re listening. In fact, you can fully customize your survey, as well as tailor follow-up questions based on the initial 5-star survey response. 
  how_surveys_help: How <span>5-star surveys</span> help companies like yours
  the_star_rating: The 5-star rating system can not only help make people feel more confident about their purchasing decisions, but it can also guide those decisions.<br><br> Whether it’s ordering from a restaurant, buying a new pair of pants from an ecommerce store, scheduling an appointment with a new dentist, or purchasing any other goods and services, consumers rely on this well-known system to weed out “bad” options and find the “best” ones. Without the stars, offerings on large online platforms would be a lot more overwhelming. <br><br>Your marketing team can also feature compelling customer comments from 5-star surveys on your website and social media, or use them in email marketing to boost conversions rates and improve your bottom line.

  a_simple_tell_us: A simple “tell us what you think” can sometimes be so much more effective in finding out what matters to your respondents the most than bombarding them with long surveys and multiple-choice questions that are not relevant to their personal experience.<br><br>General or open-ended feedback allows you to get more authentic responses from your customers, employees, and other stakeholders so that you can learn what they think about your business, event, products, services, and any other relevant topics.<br><br>This particular format tends to yield rich insights that your company can use to improve those areas of business that require it most — whether it’s customer support, product, marketing, HR, or even high-level strategy. Unlike closed-ended questions, where all the possible answers are already listed, open-ended questions allow you to receive unexpected feedback that you may otherwise not be able to predict or think to ask.

  while_open_ended: While open-ended responses tend to involve a fair dose of subjective opinions and personal feelings, this qualitative data will allow you to establish a communication channel with your stakeholders and give them a venue to voice their opinions — whether they’re positive or negative.<br><br>The main advantage of open-ended questions is that they appear less threatening to respondents, so they are more likely to give uncensored, honest responses. Conversely, this will help you understand how your respondents think, identify their priorities, and gather other valuable nuggets of information that — when used in a proactive, systematic way — can impact your business positively.<br><br>FeedbackLabs allows you to effortlessly gather and use qualitative data in the form of open-ended answers in a meaningful, scalable way. You can see all of your incoming feedback in a single, central dashboard and filter it by keywords. You can also assign each piece of customer input to specific team members so they can respond to it without delay.

  what_is_customer: What is <span>Customer Effort</span> <span>Score</span> and how does it work?
  to_improve_customer: To improve customer loyalty, start with your Customer Effort Score (CES). As a touchpoint metric, it helps you gauge how much effort your customers have to put into getting an issue resolved, request fulfilled, question answered, or product purchased or returned. By asking the customer to rate how easy or difficult it was to do something on a scale of 1–7, the survey gives you a quantifiable measure of effort and a reliable indicator of loyalty.<br><br>CES surveys are transactional — instead of measuring the overall customer experience, companies use them after a customer’s finished having an interaction with them. The idea behind the CES methodology is that customers are more loyal to a brand that’s easy to interact with, and it can be up to 40% more accurate as an indicator of customer loyalty than customer delight or satisfaction.<br><br>Unlike effortless or low-effort interactions, interactions that are difficult or high-effort add varying degrees of friction for customers. For example, having to fill in their information more than once, switch channels to get their issue resolved, go through too many steps to complete a task, interact with multiple customer service agents, or struggle to find useful timely information.

  how_customer_effort: How <span>Customer Effort</span> <span>Score</span> helps teams like yours
  when_customers: When customers have an issue and need to resolve it, they are four times more likely to become disloyal. On the other side, the more loyal a customer is, the more likely they are to stay, spend more, and give you referrals. Reducing customer effort is critical to achieving this.<br><br>The opportunity lies in optimizing each touchpoint to ensure you do not create disloyal customers who speak ill of your brand at any stage of the customer journey. Not only does delivering an effortless or low-effort experience to your customers drive customer loyalty and growth, but it also helps you cut attrition rates while lowering customer care costs and freeing up resources.<br><br>FeedbackLabs’ CES surveys are quick and intuitive for your customers to respond to while uncovering the points of friction that they encounter at specific touchpoints. They are simple to implement across multiple channels and can be scheduled at specific intervals. And in tandem with general surveys, they give you actionable insights you need to deliver an effortless experience every time.

  what_is_customer: What is a <span>Customer</span> <span>Satisfaction</span> and how does it work?
  customer_satisfaction: Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) is a customer metric used to measure how your product, service, and overall experience either fall short, meet, or exceed customer expectations. The CSAT survey most commonly asks a variation of the question, “‘How satisfied [are/were] you with the [goods/service] you received?” CSAT survey questions need to be brief, to the point and should assure the customer that the company is genuinely concerned. Respondents answer using a 5-point scale, ranging from very unsatisfied to very satisfied. <br><br>Some average out their results to get a Composite CSAT, but most express them as a percentage scale — 100% being total customer satisfaction, and 0% being total dissatisfaction. The method for calculating CSAT is somewhat similar to the NPS® method, wherein only the highest values — in this case, (4) or ‘satisfied’ and (5) or ‘very satisfied’ — are included in the calculation. These can most accurately and reliably predict customer retention.

  how_csat: How <span>CSAT</span> helps customer success teams like yours
  csat_matters: CSAT matters because companies that actively prioritize customer satisfaction grow and increase revenue. With 86% of consumers willing to pay more if that means they’ll get a better experience, it’s evident that this has become a key differentiator today — not even price or the product itself. When you maximize satisfaction rates across the customer journey, you can boost your revenue by up to 15% and lower the cost of serving customers by as much as 20%.<br><br>If you don’t place a premium on customer satisfaction, you won’t be aware of problems or complaints until it’s too late. FeedbackLabs’ CSAT surveys help you assure your customers that you care about their experience and offer them an open line of communication.<br><br>They also help prevent negative word-of-mouth and keep customers happy by giving you the information and tools you need to address dissatisfaction before it evolves into a problem. FeedbackLabs makes it effortless to respond to your CSAT surveys consistently, allowing you to close the loop on a customer interaction while identifying trouble spots and recurring complaints.

  what_is_a_product: What is <span>product market</span> <span>fit</span> and how does it work?
  most_businesses: Most businesses fail, many struggle, and few thrive. And for your business to thrive, there have to be plenty of people interested in what you’re selling and enough who are willing to pay for it. But product-market fit matters more to the future of your business than brilliant marketing ideas, a talented dev team, or any other factor.<br><br>Startup coach and investor Marc Andreessen defines product-market fit (PMF) as “being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.” When an up-and-coming company builds a product that customers in a target market are ready to buy because it solves a specific problem better than their competitors, plus when there are a lot of potential users and acquisition is easy, that’s product-market fit.<br><br>To set yourself apart from competitors and build a product that people will use and recommend to others, you need to identify the things that competitors are not doing and adapt to fill unmet needs. And to maintain product-market fit, you must keep your finger on the pulse of the market and stay flexible amid change.

  customer_persona: Customer persona, sometimes referred to as buyer persona, reveals insights about your buyers’ specific (and underlying) needs, behaviors, concerns, and any other considerations that might drive them to choose you over your competitors. <br><br> The purpose of this tool is to give you an insight into what your existing and prospective buyers think when they think about doing business with you so that you can better align your marketing and sales tactics with their expectations. <br><br> A customer persona is not a simple description of your ideal buyer and the demographic qualities that define them. In fact, a focus on demographics takes away from the tool’s intended value, which is to give you an understanding of the motivations that drive specific segments of your target audience and the problems they want your brand to solve for them. A strong customer persona is, therefore, based on real customers, their real-life needs, and extensive data and research.
