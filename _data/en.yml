  about_us: About us
  codekeeper_was_founded: Codekeeper was founded by people from the technology industry. It made no sense to us that source code escrow would not be directly integrated with modern software development platforms. So we built a completely new modernized platform for source code escrow that combines traditional legal security with modern technology workflows.
  after_our_soft: After our soft launch 6 years ago, we launched our SaaS solutions 4 years ago. Today, Codekeeper ensures that our clients have reliably up-to-date source code deposits, and we also offer official escrow agreements, release terms, beneficiary management, data escrow, verification, and an arsenal of other services.

  we_keep: We keep your costs low from the get-go. The only extra fees you pay are for a thorough legal and technical analyses of deposited materials—should you require them in case of a release event. Our pricing is simple and designed to meet the needs of agile companies while saving them thousands of dollars that they would normally pay upfront.

  site_selection: SITE SELECTION<br>Prior to choosing a location, our data center partner performs initial environmental and geographic assessments. Data center locations are carefully selected to mitigate environmental risks, such as flooding, extreme weather, and seismic activity. Our storage are built to be independent and physically separated from one another.<br><br>REDUNDANCY<br>Data centers are designed to anticipate and tolerate failure while maintaining service levels. In case of failure, automated processes move traffic away from the affected area. Core applications are deployed to an N+1 standard, so that in the event of a data center failure, there is sufficient capacity to enable traffic to be load-balanced to the remaining sites.<br><br>AVAILABILITY<br>Our data center partner has identified critical system components required to maintain the availability of our system and recover service in the event of outage. Critical system components are backed up across multiple, isolated locations. Each location  is engineered to operate independently with high reliability. Locations are connected to enable you to easily architect applications that automatically fail-over between locations without interruption. Highly resilient systems, and therefore service availability, is a function of the system design. Through the use of locations and data replication, our data center partner can achieve extremely short recovery time and recovery point objectives, as well as the highest levels of service availability.<br><br>CAPACITY PLANNING<br>Our data center partner continuously monitors service usage to deploy infrastructure to support our availability commitments and requirements. Our data center partner maintains a capacity planning model that assesses our infrastructure usage and demands at least monthly. This model supports planning of future demands and includes considerations such as information processing, telecommunications, and audit log storage

  source_code_escrow: Source Code Escrow
  source_code_escrow_is: Source code escrow is an agreement set up between a software developer or vendor (aka “Depositor” or “Licensor”), their client who is purchasing the software license (aka “Beneficiary” or “Licensee”), and a trusted third party such as Codekeeper (“Escrow Agent”). In particular, source code escrow puts a contractual obligation on the depositor to store—with a trusted escrow agent—all source code, data, build instructions, third-party tools, and anything else that would enable the beneficiary to update or maintain the software.

  you_have_total_control: You have total control over your plan usage with Secure Vault. Each plan comes with a number of Secure Vault Options that you can choose to fill with
  source_code_repositories: source code repositories, data storage vaults or information vaults.
  software_escrow: Software Escrow
  software_escrow_and: “Software escrow” and “source code escrow” are terms that are used interchangeably. This is the most common type of escrow, and it is designed to store not only source code but also build instructions and any other important documentation that would allow a beneficiary to update and maintain a mission-critical software application. Though software escrow is most commonly used for traditional on-site software licenses, it can also be used for development agreements, software acquisition agreements, SaaS applications (see below), and any other transactions involving software.
  data_escrow2: Data Escrow
  data_escrow_applies: Data escrow applies to custodians of data, such as service providers or internet domain registries, and it ensures that up-to-date copies of domain name ownership and contact details are held in escrow in the event of a registry’s business or technical failure. Sometimes it is used in tandem with domain escrow, which holds the credentials of a domain and helps reduce risk when purchasing a domain or using a domain as collateral. Just like source code escrow, data and domain escrows ensure that up-to-date copies of data and other predetermined deposit materials are held in escrow by a trusted third party such as Codekeeper, which releases the materials only when one or more release conditions has been met.
  information_escrow: Information Escrow
  information_escrow_allows: Information escrow allows companies to transmit sensitive information to a trusted intermediary, an escrow agent, who only forwards the information under prespecified conditions. Specifically, in the business context, it assists companies with securing sensitive documents, which can only be released under certain predefined conditions. Information escrow is most commonly used when part of the product development process is outsourced to a third-party designer; or when a transaction is taking place, and a trusted third party is required to store the documents until certain milestones are met. It is also frequently used to hold intellectual property and other sensitive and confidential information that can be stored physically, electronically, or in the cloud.
  saas_escrows: SaaS escrows
  saas_escrow_is_similar: SaaS escrow is similar to a regular software or source code escrow. However, it is tailored to the unique needs of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, which often require a more robust solution to obtain a required level of protection. Much like software escrow, SaaS escrow contains code, virtual machines, data, and any other components necessary to ensure a SaaS product remains viable in the event the original vendor is no longer able to support it.
            By establishing a SaaS escrow agreement, a company that subscribes to a SaaS application (beneficiary) protects itself from a potential sudden loss of access to critical SaaS services—whether temporary or long-term—and secures direct access to a running copy of the software and their own customer data in case release conditions are met.

  data_escrow: Data Escrow
  learn_how: Learn how data escrow protects software developers and their clients<br> as part of end-user licensing and service level agreements.
  get_started: GET STARTED
  what_is_data: What is data escrow?
  without_the: Without the necessary data, it is immensely hard to bring and keep a software application in a usable and useful state. Data escrow is an effective way of ensuring that any data created and managed by a business-critical software application is <strong>never at risk of being lost or inaccessible.</strong><br><br>Specifically, by deploying data escrow, the applicaton’s end-user (licensee) ensures they are always able to access the most up-to-date copy of the data they need to <strong>operate critical functions</strong> and <strong>ensure business continuity.</strong> The data in escrow can only be <strong>released</strong> to the licensee under predefined (and verified) conditions, such as in the event of a natural disasters or their licensor running out of business.
  definition: Definition
  data_escrow_is: <strong>Data escrow</strong> is a specialized data protection solution designed to maintain the safety and integrity of data essential to the proper functioning of a mission-critical software application.
  who_is_data: Who is data escrow for?
  any_company: Any company that builds software applications and their clients.<br><br>While data escrow is not intended to replace operational backups, security-minded companies that commission software use data escrow to bolster their risk mitigation. Software developers, on the other hand, use it to boost sales by strengthening their business case and providing more value to their clients.
  why_do_people: Why do people use data escrow?
  when_you_build: When you build and use a software application, you create data. There is no way around it. And this data can be stored in environments where software is deployed and executed, including databases in different physical locations, asset stores like AWS S3 and Microsoft Azure, in-memory databases, and many others.<br><br><strong>In case critical data suddenly becomes inaccessible for any reason, your software application would lose its normal functionality.</strong>
  what_can_cause: What can cause data loss?
  data_loss: Data loss occurs when data is accidentally deleted or something causes it to become corrupted. Viruses, physical damage, formatting errors, or a combination of these can render data unreadable by both humans and software, posing a <strong>risk to the financial health</strong> of businesses of all sizes.
  data_escrow_for_agile: Data escrow for agile companies
  discover_how: Discover how Codekeeper’s modern escrow solutions help leading global companies protect the data they need to operate critical business functions.
  according_to_the: According to the ICANN Registry Agreement, all registry operators of generic Top Level Domains (gTLDs) are required to create a daily backup of the domain name registration data they are managing and to transfer it to a reputable escrow agent.<br><br>
    In addition to gTLD operators, data escrow is also used by ccTLD operators. Though they have no obligation to escrow their data, they often do so to minimize potential risks. In case a release condition is met, escrowed data can be retrieved at any time.

source_escrow:
  source_code: Source Code Escrow
  learn_how: Learn how source code escrow protects software developers and their<br> clients as part of end-user licensing and service level agreements.
  get_started: GET STARTED
  what_is_source: What is source code escrow?
  source_code_escrow_puts: Source code escrow puts a contractual obligation on a <strong>software developer or supplier</strong> (licensor) to store the complete and up-to-date source code — and sometimes also object code — of a business-critical application in a format readable by humans with a trusted escrow agent such as Codekeeper.<br><br>In particular, by escrowing the source code of a critical application, the <strong>end-user</strong> (licensee) protects their <strong>software investment</strong> by means of ensuring they can <strong>maintain and update</strong> it irrespective of the developer or supplier's operational statuses. Such circumstances include the software developer discontinuing maintenance and support, running out of business, or breaching the licensing agreement in any other way.
  definition: Definition
  source_code_escrow_is: <strong>Source code escrow</strong> is a specialized software protection solution designed to store the source code of a critical software application, ensuring access in case the software's maintenance cannot otherwise be assured, as defined in agreed-upon conditions.
  who_is_source: Who is source code escrow for?
  it_is_intended: It is intended for all <strong>software developers and suppliers</strong> who deploy business-critical, on-site software applications as part of service level and license agreements, as well as <strong>their clients (end-users).</strong><br><br>Though source code escrow is most commonly used for traditional on-site software licenses, it’s a <strong>versatile software protection solution</strong> that can also be employed for development agreements, software acquisition agreements, and other transactions involving software.
  why_do_developers: Why do developers use source code escrow?
  successful_software: Successful software developers and suppliers leverage source code escrow during licensing negotiations to <strong>offer more value</strong> to their clients and <strong>stand out from competitors</strong>, which is why some business development executives refer to it as <strong>“the great sales enabler.”</strong> By storing source code in a secure location, developers also deploy source code escrow to <strong>increase security</strong> and <strong>protect intellectual property.</strong>
  why_do_end_users: Why do end-users use source code escrow?
  licensees: Licensees — companies whose operations rely on third-party software applications — primarily use it to <strong>mitigate risks.</strong> With the ability and documented right to maintain and update essential parts of a critical software product, end-users <strong>reduce the chance of interruption</strong> or damage to their business and <strong>ensure business continuity</strong> in case their software supplier undergoes acquisition, runs out of business, fails to provide adequate maintenance, or otherwise breaches the agreement.

  what_is_information: What is information escrow?
  information_escrow_allows: Information escrow allows companies to transmit sensitive information via a trusted intermediary — typically an escrow agent such as Codekeeper — to prevent the risk of disclosing critical, classified information to unauthorized parties. <br><br> Specifically, in the business context, information escrow assists companies with securing access keys, encryption keys, patents, and all other sensitive assets. The escrow agent attests to the ownership, content, and creation date of the escrowed materials, releasing them to the designated beneficiary only under specific, predefined, contractually agreed-upon conditions.

  get_started: GET STARTED
  what_is_saas: What is SaaS escrow?
  in_simple_terms: In simple terms, SaaS escrow secures access to a running instance of a third-party cloud application that is critical to ensuring a company’s <strong>business continuity.</strong> As such, it helps avoid both temporary and long-term <strong>disruption to the end-user’s regular business operations</strong> — and consequently, <strong>prevents financial loss</strong> — regardless of their developer’s or supplier’s operational status.<br><br>In addition to the application’s ever-evolving source code, SaaS escrow can also contain data, virtual machines, manuals, credentials, and any other assets or information needed to ensure its <strong>continued viability</strong> or <strong>quick recovery</strong>, depending on the licensee’s required configuration.
  definition: Definition
  saas_escrow_is: <strong>SaaS escrow</strong> is a specialized software protection solution designed to protect cloud-native software applications from internal and external threats, critical errors, or incorrect configurations that can adversely affect business functions.
  who_is_saas: Who is SaaS escrow for?
  it_is_intended: It is intended for all <strong>software developers and suppliers</strong> who ship Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications as part of service level and license agreements, as well as <strong>their clients (end-users).</strong><br><br>SaaS escrow typically secures <strong>root access</strong> to the application's live environment or any assets necessary for virtualizing the application in a new one. Alternatively, a risk-averse company may also deploy a <strong>standby, running copy</strong> to ensure minimal to no downtime in emergencies.
  why_do_developers: Why do developers use SaaS escrow?
  modern_saas_escrow: Modern SaaS escrow easily integrates with agile workflows, providing <strong>software developers</strong> an easy way to meet licensing obligations, achieve compliance, and <strong>protect intellectual property (IP)</strong>. It acts as a <strong>point of differentiation</strong> and gives software suppliers a <strong>competitive advantage</strong> in an oversaturated market, allowing them to provide extra value (and peace of mind) to their clients and ultimately boost profits.
  why_do_end_users: Why do end-users use SaaS escrow?
  licensees: <strong>Licensees</strong> (i.e., companies whose operations rely on third-party, cloud-based software applications) use SaaS escrow to <strong>protect their software</strong> in case the developer undergoes acquisition, runs out of business, or fails to meet their contractual obligations in any other way. By <strong>securing access</strong> to source code, data, and other critical assets, licensees <strong>mitigate risks</strong> and <strong>prevent disruption</strong> to critical systems.
