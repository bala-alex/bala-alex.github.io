Data center locations are carefully selected to mitigate environmental risks, such as flooding, extreme weather, and seismic activity. Our storage are built to be independent and physically separated from one another.<br><br>REDUNDANCY<br>Data centers are designed to anticipate and tolerate failure while maintaining service levels. In case of failure, automated processes move traffic away from the affected area. Core applications are deployed to an N+1 standard, so that in the event of a data center failure, there is sufficient capacity to enable traffic to be load-balanced to the remaining sites.<br><br>AVAILABILITY<br>Our data center partner has identified critical system components required to maintain the availability of our system and recover service in the event of outage. Critical system components are backed up across multiple, isolated locations. Each location  is engineered to operate independently with high reliability. Locations are connected to enable you to easily architect applications that automatically fail-over between locations without interruption. Highly resilient systems, and therefore service availability, is a function of the system design. Through the use of locations and data replication, our data center partner can achieve extremely short recovery time and recovery point objectives, as well as the highest levels of service availability.<br><br>CAPACITY PLANNING<br>Our data center partner continuously monitors service usage to deploy infrastructure to support our availability commitments and requirements. Our data center partner maintains a capacity planning model that assesses our infrastructure usage and demands at least monthly. This model supports planning of future demands and includes considerations such as information processing, telecommunications, and audit log storage

Ingress and egress points to server rooms are secured with devices that require each individual to provide multi-factor authentication before granting entry or exit.
