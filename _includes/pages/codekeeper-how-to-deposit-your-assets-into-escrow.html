        <p class="header__timestamp-text">In this video we'll learn how to deposit your assets to software escrow using automated integration method. Let's get started. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="d-flex mt-4">
        <p class="header__timestamp">00:12</p>
        <p class="header__timestamp-text">In order to set up automated deposits, we first have to activate your working integrations by selecting the Integrations menu on the sidebar. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="d-flex mt-4">
        <p class="header__timestamp">00:21</p>
        <p class="header__timestamp-text">In this case, we'll activate GitHub integration so you can link your repositories to our platform. Start by clicking the activate button, then we'll have this pop-up message to connect directly to GitHub by signing in and granting Codekeeper access to your repository. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="d-flex mt-4">
        <p class="header__timestamp">00:38</p>
        <p class="header__timestamp-text"> After the integration is successfully connected, you'll see this pop-up confirmation message meaning your GitHub repositories are ready for the deposit process. You also can confirm that it's activated in the active Integrations section. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="d-flex mt-4">
        <p class="header__timestamp">00:53</p>
