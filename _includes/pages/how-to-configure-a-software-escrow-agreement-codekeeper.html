        Hi.
        Welcome to Codekeeper.
        In this video, we'll learn how to configure a new software escrow agreement.
        Let's get started!
        After you sign up, you will see this dashboard when logging in to your account.
        We’ll start by clicking this “Create new escrow” button, and the escrow configuration window will open.
        Basics
        The setup is done following these 4 steps on the sidebar, and we’ll go through each one by one.
        Starting with the BASICS.
        Within this first step you configure the escrow role.
        Select whether you are the one who will deposit assets, or will receive source code repositories.
        In this case I am the Depositor.
        After specifying the role, we select the type of the agreement.
        Let's select Tripartite, meaning the agreement will be signed by the depositor, Codekeeper as the escrow
        agent, and the beneficiary.
        Then click “Save and next”.
        Required Details
        After the basics, we are going to fill in all required details for both depositor and beneficiary, starting
        with my organization and signatory details.
        We’ll need at least one representative for the entire escrow configuration process.
        On the side of the beneficiary, we heet this invite checkbox to invite the beneficiary to access the escrow
        information once the agreement is generated.
        Save & Next.
        This is the Deposits step where you can configure the deposit notifications for the beneficiary - in
        this process we’ll leave it as default.
        next and final step.
        Agreement Settings
        Within the Agreement settings, we will configure the legal context, assets types, release conditions, liability
        and other agreement related settings.
        In this example, we will go for license and development agreement.
        As Deposit type, we select source code.
        Then for release conditions we select Bankruptcy here.
        After all details are set and entered correctly, we save them and get to see this popup message.
        Confirm by Selecting Generate agreement.
        The escrow agreement has now been sent to Codekeeper for processing and will be shared soon.
        When the agreement is ready for review and approval, you and the beneficiary will receive an email.
