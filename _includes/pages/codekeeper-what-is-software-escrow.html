        <p class="header__timestamp-text">Software escrow is a service provided by agents like Codekeeper that allows you to place mission-critical software that your business relies on on a daily basis into escrow. Let's say your software provider goes out of business, or is bought out by your competitor. </p>

We help you set up an escrow agreement, negotiate the terms of the agreement, and step in as a mediator when a release event is triggered. </p>
